This presentation guides you through the creation of a user-friendly Excel dashboard for in-depth analysis of cancer referrals data. The dashboard showcases key insights and trends in referral patterns, processing times, breach rates, and geographical distribution. By visualising data through charts and graphs, we empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, identify areas for improvement, and prioritise timely patient care. Experience the impact of data visualisation in action as we navigate the world of cancer referrals, uncovering valuable insights that can shape healthcare strategies for the better.
